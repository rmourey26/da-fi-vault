# Deploy a Strategy / Vault for V2

**Note**: This [repo](https://github.com/iearn-finance/chief-multisig-officer) is encouraged to create multiple scripts for governance and dev multisig execution of complex transactions.

## Process for new vault release

- Check latest version in `v2.registry.ychad.eth` against the planned new release vault to be sure its an updated version.
- Deploy vault for production using the new version (this should not be an experimental vault since it will be endorsed with this process).
- Set governance to `ychad.eth`:

  ```python
  vault.setGovernance(0xfeb4acf3df3cdea7399794d0869ef76a6efaff52)
  ```

- Let multisig accept governance:

  ```python
  vault.acceptGovernance()
  ```

- Let governance create a new release on `v2.registry.ychad.eth`:

  ```python
  registry.newRelease(vault)
  ```

**Note**: Last two steps may need to be done in different transactions since it sometimes can fail in practice using multisig from Gnosis.

## Before deployment

- Create a new issue in the strategies' [repo](https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-strategies/issues) using the template `Strategy Review`. **Complete all the fields**.
- Coordinate with Core Dev strategist for getting a review on [board](https://github.com/orgs/iearn-finance/projects/5).
- Complete peer review by at least 2 strategists.
- Check if `want` token has a deployed vault already (>=v0.3.0) and coordinate to use that first if possible.
- If a new vault is needed, deploy it using the registry:

  - Set strategists multisig (`0x16388463d60FFE0661Cf7F1f31a7D658aC790ff7`) as governance.
  - Set Core Dev multisig (`dev.ychad.eth`) as guardian.
  - Set treasury (`treasury.ychad.eth`) as the rewards address.

  ```python
  token = want
  governance = '0x16388463d60FFE0661Cf7F1f31a7D658aC790ff7'
  guardian = '0x846e211e8ba920B353FB717631C015cf04061Cc9'
  treasury = '0x93A62dA5a14C80f265DAbC077fCEE437B1a0Efde'
  name = ''
  symbol = ''

  registry.newExperimentalVault(token, governance, guardian, treasury, name, symbol)
  ```

- Check new vault has ABI setup on etherscan (until verification with Vyper and proxy is fixed on Etherscan).
- Coordinate with core developer to set proper deposit limit and other settings for new vault. See the table below: [Limits per Stage](#limits-per-stage).
- Set a deposit limit to \$50k USD converted to your `want` token. Example below is 50k DAI

  ```python
  vault.setDepositLimit(50_000 * 1e18)
  ```

- Deploy strategy and upload code to Etherscan for verification.
- Tag GitHub review issue with deployed version and add mainnet address(es) to the [board](https://github.com/orgs/iearn-finance/projects/5).

## After deployment

- Add strategy to vault (for vault code v0.3.3+):

  ```python
  strategy = ''                     # Your strategy address
  debt_ratio = 9800                 # 98%
  minDebtPerHarvest = 0             # Lower limit on debt add
  maxDebtPerHarvest = 2 ** 256 - 1  # Upper limit on debt add
  performance_fee = 1000            # Strategist perf fee: 10%

  vault.addStrategy(
    strategy, 
    debt_ratio, 
    minDebtPerHarvest,
    maxDebtPerHarvest,
    performance_fee
  )
  ```

  - `debt_ratio` should be `9800` if first strategy on vault.
  - `rate_limit` is `0` unless there is reason for it to be different.

- Set keeper:

  ```python
  strategy.setKeeper(keep3r_manager)
  ```

  - `keep3r_manager` = `0x13dAda6157Fee283723c0254F43FF1FdADe4EEd6`

- Set rewards:

  ```python
  strategy.setRewards(address)
  ```

  - Read [below](<#Sharer-contract-(optional)>) if you want to use the sharer contract.

- Set management fee to 0:

  ```python
  vault.setManagementFee(0)
  ```

- Set `dev.ychad.eth` as governance

  ```python
  multisig = '0x846e211e8ba920b353fb717631c015cf04061cc9'
  vault.setGovernance(multisig)
  ```

  - Governance needs to be accepted before it is in place. After you set this you will still have control over the strategy.

- Run tests against "live" vault and strategy in mainnet-fork:

  - Harvest.
  - Profitable harvest.
  - Revoke strategy and check that funds return to the vault.
  - Increase/decrease debt + harvest, and check that the strategy is working well.
  - Migration.
  - Check that tokens in the strategy cannot be sweeped by dust collection.

  Example: Hegic strat [repo](https://github.com/Macarse/yhegic/tree/master/tests/development).

- Tag vault as "experimental" in `v2.registry.ychad.eth`
  - `registry.tagVault(vaultAddr, "https://meta.yearn.network/vaults/${vaultAddr}/vault.json")`

### Sharer contract (optional)

"Sharer" is a contract for distributing/splitting strategist rewards. For boarding school graduates suggested split is 34% to strategist multisig and 66% to strategist â€“ [repo](https://github.com/Grandthrax/Sharer).

- Setup rewards for your strategy by calling `sharer.addContributors`.
- Include devs if you forked someone else's strategy.
- Be sure to reward people who helped you.
- You can find the sharer here: [0x2c641e14afecb16b4aa6601a40ee60c3cc792f7d](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2c641e14afecb16b4aa6601a40ee60c3cc792f7d)

### Example Script

```python
# TBD Fill CMO example script to fill
```

## The Manual Phase

- Deposit some `want` tokens into the vault.
- Do first `harvest` and make sure it worked correctly.

  ```python
  strategy.harvest()
  ```

- If you need a UI to test, you can coordinate with the strategists.

- Monitor `harvest` and `tend` triggers for first few days. Call `harvest`/`tend` manually.

## Scaling up / Moving to Endorse

- In additon to the 2 strategists, a Core Developer has to review the strategy before going into production.
- Increase limits.
- Add to experimental tab on yearn.finance.
- Set management fee to production level:

  ```python
  vault.setManagementFee(200)
  ```

- Set governance to `ychad.eth`:

  ```python
  vault.setGovernance(0xfeb4acf3df3cdea7399794d0869ef76a6efaff52)
  ```

- Yearn governance now must accept governance and endorse the vault:
  **Note**: Order is important. Will fail if order is wrong.

Endorsing a vault from latest release (use instructions for previous release below) :

```python
strategy.acceptGovernance() # from ychad.eth
registry.endorseVault(vault) # from ychad.eth
```

Or if you are endorsing a vault from previous release:

1. Check for latest release number in the registry contract
2. Check the apiVersion of the vault you want to endorse to identify target release
3. Calculate the releaseDelta from your target release. (see registry endorseVault param details)
   E.g: latestRelease = 0.3.3 and numReleases = 5. New vault apiVersion is 0.3.2
   `releaseDelta = numReleases - 1 - releaseTarget`
4. Confirm using registry.releases(uint256) that your targetRelease has the same apiVersion as your vault.

```python
 releaseTarget = 3 # e.g vault api version 0.3.2
 releaseDelta = registry.numReleases() - 1 - releaseTarget # (5-1-3) = 1
 strategy.acceptGovernance() # from ychad.eth
 registry.endorseVault(vault, releaseDelta) # from ychad.eth.
```

- Now you are on main yearn page!

## Setting up Keep3r

- Adjust trigger variables until they are correct:
  - `strategy.setProfitFactor()`
  - `strategy.setDebtThreshold()`
  - `strategy.setMaxReportDelay()`
- Set strategy's Keep3r role to v2-keeper-contract (TBD)
- Create an add-strategy PR in Keep3r [repo](https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-keeper) (TBD)

## Limits per Stage

These are the standard deposit limits per stage. They can be adjusted on a case by case basis.

| Stage        | Limit  |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Experimental | \$500K |
| Production   | \$10M  |

## Revoking a strategy with normal migration

Let's say we found a problem in one of the strategies and we want to return all funds. There are two ways of doing it.

The scripts below use the HEGIC vault as an example.

### From the vault

```python
# Grab the gov account
gov = accounts.at(vault.governance(), force=True)

# The cream strategy is the first in the withdrawal queue
s1 = Contract(vault.withdrawalQueue(0))

# Revoke msg should be sent from gov or guardian
vault.revokeStrategy(s1, {"from": gov})
```

After running the command you will notice:

```python
vault.strategies(s1).dict()['debtRatio'] == 0
```

Last step is running a `harvest` to return funds to vault:

```python
s1.harvest({"from": gov})
>>> hegic.balanceOf(s1)
0
>>> hegic.balanceOf(vault)/1e18
291731.2666932462
```

### From the strategy

From the strategy itself we can turn on emergency mode.
To do it we need to run:

```python
# Grab the strategist account
strategist = accounts.at(s1.strategist(), force=True)

# Turn on the emergency exit
s1.setEmergencyExit({'from': strategist})

# Harvest to move funds to the vault
s1.harvest({'from': strategist})
```

We should also see the strategy's `debtRatio` going to `0` and funds returning to the vault.

## Emergency Procedures

We can also shutdown the vault to return assets as soon as possible. To do that we will need a guardian or governance account:

```python
# Sound the alarm
vault.setEmergencyShutdown(true, {'from': gov})

# Harvest all strategies
s1.harvest({'from': gov})
s2.harvest({'from': gov})
s3.harvest({'from': gov})

# Check all the tokens are back in the vault
>>> hegic.balanceOf(vault) == vault.totalAssets()
True
```

You will notice that this procedure doesn't change the debt ratio:

```python
>>> vault.strategies(s1).dict()['debtRatio']
1600
```

It drops the credit to `0`:

```python
>>> vault.creditAvailable(s1)
0
```
